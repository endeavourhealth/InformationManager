#Vanilla database creation
Instructions for generating a vanilla database from scratch.


## Information Model database

### Initial database creation
Run the following scripts, in order: -
* `01.schema.sql` - Drop/create the database schema
* `02.tables.sql` - Drop/create the core information model tables

N.B look up tables will also be created as part of the population - see [InformationManager/Transforms/README](\\Transforms/README.md)
